# Bruyant

[Bruyant](https://github.com/sully-vian/bruyant) is a simple [Typst](https://typst.app/) package for generating noise. It currently supports [Perlin Noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise), direct implementation of the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise#Algorithm_detail)

## Features

- A simple `perlin(x,y)` function which returns a noise value between -1 and 1 with respect to the perlin noise algorithm.

## Future Features:

- Support for the [Simplex Noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_noise) which is less compute-intensive
